# UnityGUIProductCustomizer
A Unity project that demonstrates the use of Cinemachine and simple scripting to allow you to customize a character using ui elements.

During this process I was learning to use Cinemachine on Unity (2021). This program uses some preset assets to custome an action hero in front of a shop. You are able to customize gear, gear color, character sex and character color and some other aspects.
